/**
 * This class is responsible for manipulating the data in the backend, and
 * letting the user otherwise control the GUI on the screen.
 *
 * Responsibilities of this class include:
 *
 * (1) Ask the MainViewDisplay object to change the GUI on the screen in
 * response to user input actions (without modifying any data in the backend).
 *
 * (2) Ask the backend models to modify its data, and also ask the
 * MainViewDisplay object to update the GUI on the screen (to match the data in
 * the backend), in response to user input actions.
 *
 * There should be no code here directly about painting graphics on the screen!
 * That belongs in the MainViewDisplay class.
 *
 * There should also be no code here directly about modeling the problem or
 * situation your program solves.
 *
 * All problem or situation modeling related code must go in the backend classes
 *
 * The FOUR (4) main steps to creating GUI widgets are labeled below. There are
 * many smaller steps you should get familiar with as well.
